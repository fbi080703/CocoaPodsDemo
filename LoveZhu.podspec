        A longer description of CocoaPodsDemo in Markdown format.
        * Think: Why did you write this? What is the focus? What does it do?
        * CocoaPods will be using this to generate tags, and improve search results.
        * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.
        * Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!
